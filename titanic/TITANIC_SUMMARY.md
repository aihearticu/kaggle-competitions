# Kaggle Titanic Competition Summary

## Current Performance
- **Best Score**: 0.77990 (77.99% accuracy)
- **Model**: Simplified Random Forest with key features
- **CV Score**: 0.8282 (indicates some overfitting to training data)

## Submissions Made
1. **Weighted Ensemble**: 0.77511
   - 23 features with advanced engineering
   - CV score 0.84 but lower public score (overfitting)

2. **Simplified RF**: 0.77990
   - Fewer features, better generalization
   - CV score 0.8282

## Key Learnings
1. **Feature Quality > Quantity**: Simpler model with key features performed better
2. **Most Important Features**:
   - Title (Mr, Mrs, Miss, Master, Rare)
   - Sex (male/female)
   - Pclass (passenger class)
   - Family Size
   - Age
   - Fare

3. **CV vs Public Score Gap**: ~5% difference suggests need for better validation strategy

## Path to 0.80+ Score
Based on research, to reach 0.80+ (top ~15%):
1. Better handling of missing ages
2. More sophisticated title groupings
3. Ticket number patterns
4. Cabin deck extraction
5. Family survival rates
6. Proper ensemble of diverse models

## Files Created
- `titanic_solution.py` - Full featured solution with ensemble
- `titanic_improved.py` - Simplified but effective RF model
- `submission_weighted.csv` - Ensemble submission (0.77511)
- `submission_improved.csv` - RF submission (0.77990)

## Next Steps for Top 10%
To achieve 0.82+ score:
1. Implement semi-supervised learning using test set patterns
2. Create more sophisticated family group features
3. Use stacking with XGBoost meta-learner
4. Engineer interaction features (Age*Class, Sex*Class)
5. Optimize threshold (may not be 0.5)

## Submit Command
```bash
kaggle competitions submit -c titanic -f submission.csv -m "Description"
```

Current ranking: ~Top 30-35% with 0.77990 score
Target: Top 10% requires 0.82+ score
