# Healthcare AI/ML Portfolio - ICU Nurse to AI Engineer üè•

## About Me
ICU Nurse at Kaiser Permanente transitioning to Healthcare AI/ML. Combining clinical expertise with machine learning to improve patient outcomes and prevent critical care admissions.

This repository showcases my journey from bedside nursing to healthcare AI, featuring predictive models for critical conditions I've managed firsthand in the ICU, alongside Kaggle competition solutions.

## üè• Healthcare ML Projects

### 1. Heart Failure Prediction
**Performance:** 93.48% ROC-AUC | 93.14% Sensitivity

Clinical insights from managing cardiac patients in ICU:
- ST_Slope identified as strongest predictor
- Risk stratification for early intervention
- Nurse-actionable recommendations

[View Code](./heart-failure-prediction/heart_failure_analysis.py)

### 2. Stroke Prediction  
**Performance:** 78.85% ROC-AUC | Number Needed to Screen: 6

Leveraging ICU stroke management experience:
- Addressed severe class imbalance (5% stroke rate)
- Age-adjusted risk categories
- SMOTE for rare event prediction

[View Code](./stroke-prediction/stroke_prediction_advanced.py)

### 3. Diabetes Prediction
**Performance:** 82.15% ROC-AUC | 72.2% Sensitivity

Preventing DKA and HHS admissions:
- Ensemble model (LR + RF + GB + SVM)
- Metabolic syndrome scoring
- Insulin resistance early detection

[View Code](./diabetes-prediction/diabetes_prediction_advanced.py)

### 4. Sepsis Early Warning System
**Performance:** 100% ROC-AUC (Synthetic Data)

ICU-specific sepsis prediction:
- SIRS and qSOFA integration
- Multi-organ dysfunction tracking
- Alert system with nurse protocols
