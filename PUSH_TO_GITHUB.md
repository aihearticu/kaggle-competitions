# Push to GitHub Instructions

## Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to https://github.com/aihearticu
2. Click "New repository"
3. Name: `kaggle-competitions`
4. Description: "Machine Learning solutions for Kaggle competitions - ICU nurse transitioning to Healthcare AI"
5. Make it PUBLIC (to showcase your work)
6. Don't initialize with README (we already have one)

## Push Your Code

Once the repository is created on GitHub, run these commands:

```bash
cd "/Users/jamesperlas/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Kaggle/kaggle-competitions"

# If you haven't set up the remote yet:
git remote add origin https://github.com/aihearticu/kaggle-competitions.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## If You Get Authentication Error

GitHub now requires personal access tokens instead of passwords:

1. Go to GitHub Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens
2. Generate new token (classic)
3. Give it repo permissions
4. Use the token as your password when pushing

Or use GitHub Desktop app for easier authentication.

🚀 Excited to share my journey from ICU nursing to Healthcare AI!

As an ICU nurse at Kaiser, I see firsthand how data drives critical decisions. 
Now I'm building ML models to predict and improve patient outcomes.

Just launched my Kaggle competition repository showcasing:
🏥 Titanic survival prediction (78% accuracy)
🎮 ConnectX AI agent (Top 33)
📊 Roadmap for healthcare professionals entering AI/ML

## Future Additions

Add these healthcare-relevant competitions next:
1. Heart Disease Prediction
2. Diabetes Readmission
3. Sepsis Early Warning
4. ICU Length of Stay Prediction

Remember: Your unique perspective as an ICU nurse is incredibly valuable in healthcare AI!
