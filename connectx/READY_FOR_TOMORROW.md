# ConnectX Top 10 Strategy - Ready for Tomorrow

## Current Situation
- **Latest Score**: 577.2 (submission_final.py with depth 5-7)
- **Previous Best**: 722.2 (submission.py with depth 8-10)
- **Target**: 1000+ for Top 10

## Key Learning: Depth is CRITICAL
The score drop from 722.2 to 577.2 proves that reducing search depth from 8-10 to 5-7 was catastrophic. Top agents need:
- **10-15 ply search depth**
- **Bitboard optimizations for speed**
- **Strong opening book**
- **Perfect tactical play**

## Tomorrow's Strategy

### Primary Submission: `submission_ready.py`
- Based on the 722.2 scoring agent
- Uses proven 8-10 ply depth
- Enhanced with:
  - Better time management (0.9s limit)
  - Killer moves for move ordering
  - Transposition table
  - Strong opening book

### Backup Options:
1. `submission_tomorrow.py` - Balanced 7-10 ply agent
2. `champion_1000_agent.py` - Original 722.2 scorer
3. `submission_ultra.py` - Aggressive 8-12 ply

## Submission Command for Tomorrow
```bash
kaggle competitions submit -c connectx \
  -f submission_ready.py \
  -m "Deep search 8-10 ply, proven at 722.2, enhanced with killer moves and TT"
```

## Critical Success Factors
1. **NEVER reduce depth below 8 ply**
2. **Use full time allocation (0.9s)**
3. **Perfect tactical detection is mandatory**
4. **Center control is critical**

## Expected Performance
- Based on 722.2 baseline
- With enhancements: 850-950 expected
- Top 10 threshold: ~1000
- Stretch goal: 1000+
